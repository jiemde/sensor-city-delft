# Code to turn your Lopy into a nano gateway

This gateway needs special software on the node, as it uses a custom LoRa implementation (not adhering to LoRa standards).
Reason behind this is the channel limitation of the Lopy.

See the `lora_otaa_nanogw` folder for the node software that is compatible with this gateway.
